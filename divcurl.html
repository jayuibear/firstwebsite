<h1>Divergence and Curl</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When I first learned about graphing calculators, believe me, I spent countless hours cooped up in Desmos graphing all sorts of things. When I was introduced to polar and parametric functions, I did the same. When Taylor Series came around, you bet I was plotting lots of sums. When multivariable functions emerged, I was switching programs to GeoGebra to graph them. The point is, when you're introduced to a new way of visualizing math, you want to explore it somehow. So believe me when I say I had the same reaction with vector fields. These really are completely different from any other type of function so far. So, naturally, you'd want to know more things about them as soon as you stumble across them. Aside from you enjoying pretty looking vectors, it's important to be able to describe the behavior of functions as both a visual aid and to be able to reach important conclusions regarding them. The question is, then, how do you describe a vector field? Well, let's remind ourselves why we came up with them in the first place--they exist for physics, often to describe the flow of something in space. So, if you were an emerging physicist-mathematician in the early 19th century, what would you want to say about a vector field representing fluid flow? Would you want to say where it was going and how strong it was? Well, yes, but that comes in the package already--the equation describes both</p
<p>How would you describe a vector field which looks like this, rotating about the center? [image] Or what about this one, which seems to flow out of the center? [image] You could imagine that actual bodies of water or other fluids behave this way, and it might be useful to have a way to categorize them. To someone who's only used to scalar-valued functions, though, it might be a bit difficult to even assess what vector field behavior means when all we're used to doing is travelling along a path or trasversing a surface. When it comes to vector fields, it's most important to be able to see what's going on all around a point in all directions, meaning that we'll be zooming into individual points and looking around them. There are no directions we have to travel towards--the only thing is to follow the flow sometimes.  </p>
<p>The examples I just showed weren't coincidences, by the way, these are some of the most important properties there are to learn about vector fields. We'll start with the idea of vectors flowing into or out of a certain point, which seems pretty similar to flux (we will see how the idea of flux is related to flowing into or out of points with something called the Divergence Theorem). Now, if this was the first time you ever saw vector fields and were asked to quantify this idea--how much a vector field "flows in" or "flows out" of a point, how would you do it? I truly encourage you to give this a pause before going on, because it's something quite simple but also very beautiful. I will say that just like with many mathematical concepts, the best idea is to start simple and then work your way up. Well, let's draw two extremely basic vector fields: one that points inwards, and one that points outwards from a point. Before getting into it, there's one assumption that we're going to make, positive versus negative. It should be no surprise even this far out from our solution that flowing inwards and outwards will end up representing different signs, but the question is, which one is which? Well, we set the standard with flux when we said that outward flow is positive orientation. The same thing will apply here as well: if a vector field appears to be flowing out of a point, we will say our value is positive. If it appears to be flowing inwards, we'll say that it's negative. This is just conventional, but we'll see how everything comes together in a bit.</p>
<p>So, what is the most basic way that we can represent net flow out of a point? Well, we would need four vectors, that way we could create something like this: [image] So, how on earth would we describe it as "it's left on the left and right on the right?" Actually, that's exactly how we'd want to describe it. That is, how do you describe the fact that the arrow on the left starts out pointing left and then points to the right? Well, if something starts pointing in the negative direction and ends pointing in the positive, that means there was a sign change from negative to positive--a positive derivative. Okay, wait, back up, what's increasing, and with respect to what? Well, our vector is increasing, but what about our vector? It starts pointing to the left and ends up pointing to the right. In other words, the x-component of our vector increases from a negative value to a positive one. Okay, so we have that this component is increasing, but with respect to what? Well, with respect to x. As we move to the right (increase x), our vectors also point more to the right. This all translates to the fact that the partial of the x-component with respect to x is positive. Again, don't get worked up by the fact that it's "x with respect to x"--these represent diferent things. In the vector field, the x-component is the part of the vector that points in the direcion parallel to the x-axis. In the scalar field, it means moving along this axis. Anyway, we have x taken care of. What about y? Well, it seems that the vertical component of our vector is increasing as y increases, so the partial of the y-component with respect to y is greater than 0. So, for a 2D vector field, it seems that the ability to act as a sink depends on partials of components. </p>
<p>It's time to combine both of these somehow. Remember, we want a positive value to represent pointing away from our point. We want both of these partials to be greater than 0. How should we put them together--add? Multiply? Compose some other way? Well, let's consider something else--how can we generalize acting as a source versus a sink? Well, what is a source? It means that a lot of water is coming out of it, and a sink is a place where water collects. Okay, so when does a source stop becoming a source and start becomign a sink? Well, you could keep flowing more water into the source until the amount of water flowing in exceeded the amount of water flowing out. So it seems that as long as more water flows in than out then it's a sink. Likewise, if more floats out than in, it's a source. What this means, then, is that the horizontal and vertical portions of our vectors can counterract each other a bit, but as long as net flow out exceeds net flow in, our value will be greater than 0. In that case, we should add our partials together. Why? If both are positive, we'll have a source. If both are negative, we'll have a sink (try drawing out the arrows, it's good practice). Now, if the partial with respect to x is positive but the partial with respect to y is negative, </p>
