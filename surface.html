<h1> Surface Integrals </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> The interesting part about line integrals was the fact that we were able to import the idea of single integrals into three dimensions by creating a "directional integral" of sorts. We created a path in our input space to follow along. Now, though, we're going to take it one step further.</p>
<h2> Parametric Surfaces and Surface Area </h2>
<p> I'm going to ask a question whose answer we already know, and then look at it from a different perspective. How do you find the surface area of some surface in 3 dimensions? </p>
<p> We learned in chapter 15 that this is simlpy a double integral over some region where our integrand was [image] How would you find the surface area of a more complex surface like a sphere? This can't be represented as a function of x and y. You still could add up two surface area integrals of hemispheres, but think about how inconvenient this would be in this situation [image] or for a surface that looks like this </p>
<p> The problem here, similar to the one we faced when we derived the idea of line integrals, is the fact that we're trying to do something that requires 3 variables when we're used to doing it in two. When it came to line integrals, we had to do something in two variables when we only wanted one. Back then, we tried creating a sort of "directional integral", and what is our objective now?</p>
<p> You can almost think of this as a "directional double integral" in that we're no longer just concerned with what's on the floor--we want to go in many different directions up and down according to our surface. Ideally, we'd even want to somehow integrate across the surface itself. Imagine how easy that would be! </p> 
<p> But anyway, the task here is to describe a surface that needs three variables (well, sort of, we can't visualize f(x,y,z) in scalar fields very well, but it's obvious that two inputs of f(x,y) are not enough) in two variables. How should we go about doing this? Once again, the easiest idea is to simplify our problem. What should we do in the two dimensional case? When we needed to represent a path in space with one variable, we parameterized x and y with some third variable t. What should we do in this case? Well, we definitely can't only use one variable because that would be a path--how would you create that weird tangled mess of a sheet using only a path? </p>
<p> So once again we've narrowed the solution down to parameterization, but what do we need to do specifically? Well, let's think of a surface that's a lot simpler to describe in 3D to approach our answer: planes. We've worked with planes and parametric equations before--specifically, with vectors. If you recall, we identified a plane as a dot product which satisfies the following equation: [image] </p>
<p> How are we going to parameterize this? Well, recall that when we first learned about planes, we learned that one vector parallel to the plane isn't enough-we needed two vectors of which we took the cross product, which meant that we couldn't parametrically define a plane using one variable. It might be rather intuitive, then, that a parametric representation of a plane will require two variables. You might be tempted to use s and t. We will conventionally use u and v. So how will we use u and v to describe this plane? It's actually a lot easier than you might think, so easy that this will probably be redundantly confusing. We will use three functions, x(u,v), y(u,v), and z(u,v) to describe our surface. Again, remember the intuitive reason why we have to use two variables. To describe a path, you can use one, but what if you wanted to describe a sheet, like your bedsheets? You can't just say that the length is 7 feet. You also have to specify the width. Any surface requires two variables to describe its shape. </p>
<p> Okay, so are you ready for our parameterization? Well, here it is: [image]. Yeah, I know what you're thinking--we already knew that. We already knew that z was equivalent to that quantity (substituting x and y for u and v). In fact, why did we have to use u and v at all? We already knew how to describe this surface. However, look at we just did. We successfully described each coordinate of our surface using two variables despite it existing in three dimensions. This was our goal the entire time. Let's use the example of a sphere instead to make this a lot more easy and practical to understand. </p>
<p> Being able to parameterize a sphere is something that could actually come in handy (though there will be special cases of formulas down the line where z is a function of x and y which make calculations a lot simpler). How would we parametrically represent a sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin? If we were given a circle of radius 2 in 2 demensions, our only variable left would our angle, determining our x and y values based on trigonometric functions. Recall that a sphere is comprised of two angles: one on the floor, and one on the vertical axis. Do you remember what we learned from the section on spherical coordinates? These were the formulas for x, y, and z: [image] </p>
<p> We know that our radius is 2 in this case, so we can replace all values of rho with 2. All we are left with, then, is [image], which we can rewrite as [image], parametrically defined as a function of theta and phi. You can replace theta and phi with u and v and get the exact same result. This might be surprising at first, since we said that theta and phi specifically represent angles. But remember, they are simply variables--values which take some sort of input which we successfully interpret some way. This entire time we've been using a parametrically defined surface without realizing it!</p>
<p> Okay, let's look back again since we got a little bit distracted. What were we trying to do? We wanted to find the surcae area of some parametric surface. We've been able to parameterize these surfaces in 3D, but what now? Well, let's think about what we have to do and compare it to what we did back when we found the surface area of surfaces that were functions of x and y. In sum, what we want to do is sum the areas of a bunch of parallelograms on our surface. As we get more and more parallelograms, this sum approaches the true surface area. Our parallelograms change in size on different parts of our surface, which we represented as changing partial derivatives. We used the fact that the area of these parallelograms were found by finding the magnitude of the cross product of these two partial derivatives. We essentially want to do something similar this time--go across our entire surface and add up the areas of parallelograms. The problem, though, is that we no longer have a function of x and y. We have three functions of u and v which represent our surface. What do we do? </p>
<p> Ask yourself what we did when we found the surface area for a function of x and y. It's a lie to say that we integrated over our surface--we integrated over a region on our floor which marked our input space. So, you can logically assume that this time we also need to integrate over a region in our input space, only that our input space is in the uv-plane, not the xy-plane. We run into a problem real fast, though, which is that we don't want to deal with three functions. Our parametric function will be in vector form. This will also make the cross-product part easier down the line, as you might be able to imagine. Anyway, the surface area of our surface will be over some region in this new set of coordinates u and v. Remember, what's a rectangle in the uv-plane may be a totally different shape in Cartesian coordinates. Take the example of a sphere like we just saw earlier. Theta and phi lie on a "spherical rectangle" which in the theta phi plane would look like this [image]. On the other hand, what looks like a rectangular or box in three dimensions may be an extremely odd-looking shape in the uv-plane</p>
<p> What we need to do now is create a parallelogram. So let's zoom in on a little patch of our surface and look specifically at the corner. Obviously, our patch is a bit curved in Cartesian space, which we expected. However, we're going to approximate the area of this patch with a parallelogram. Remember, we need two vectors. Specifiaclly, we need to find two vectors that are tangent to the surface and then find the cross product. These vectors were our partial derivatives when we dealt with functions of x and y. What will they be this time? Let's think about why we used partial derivatives in the first place for this task. Their usefulness came from the fact that one variable was always treated as constant. That is, we could travel along our path in the x direction and describe the approximate slope, and travel along our path in the y direction and describe our approximate slope. In other words, we can describe the behavior of our entire surface by attacking it from two different directions--one along the side of one axis, and the other from that of the other axis, which would give us a tangent plane, the 3-dimensional equivalent of linearization in point-slope form from Calc I. With our parametrically-defined surface, however, our directions are no longer x and y--they are now u and v. Let's look at what happens when we hold u and v constant for some shape, say a sphere of radius 2.  </p>
<p> I've selected the point (1,1,root2) which lies directly on our sphere. We know how to convert from rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates and vice vera. I've called theta and phi u and v respectively in this case. It turns out both of our angles are pi/4, so we'll hold u and v cosntant at pi/4. This is our result: </p>
<p> Just like we did with functions of x and y, we once again approach our point from two different directions. It looks strange since our paths are circular, but just remember that our approach looks like zooming in on a rectangle in the uv-plane. So how are we going to represent area? We're going to need derivatives in some sense to represent tangent planes, but they will now be the partial derivatives with respect to u and v instead of x and y. The parallelogram formed by these tangent vectors will approximately look like one that represents a small patch on our sphere. You might have caught onto something that's a bit different this time, though. We're dealing with a vector-valued function, not a scalar one. We faced this issue with line integrals as well. Remember, if we find the derivative of a vector-valued parametric functyion, we find the derivatives of each directional component (this is like seeing how x, y, and z, will change for a small nudge in our parameter). The same logic holds for partials. We will take the partial derivartives with respect to r and u for each component of our vector. The point of seeing the "traces" on the sphere was to see that partial derivatives still make sense for parametrically defined surfaces as two ways to approach a point in R3. We now have to actually compute the partial derivatives, which are [image] </p>
<p> Let's construct a tangent plane at our point by plotting the two vectors at our point in the uv-plane, (pi/4, pi/4). [image] </p>
<p> Okay, we're almost done. The only problem here is that we haven't specified the area of our parallelogram--right now we have a plane that extends infinitely. No problem--all we have to do is take the magnitude of our cross product. However, we haven't specified how small our changes in u or v are. We will once again use the idea of the differential, which is that we can represent a small change in our output by a small change in our input times a derivative. In other words, we multiply our partial derivatives on both sides by delta u or delta v, and get that our small resulting vector (remember, this is a vector-calued function) is equal to our partial derivative vector evaluated at some point (u,v) times our small change in u or v. As our small change in u and v gets smaller, the size of our resultant vectors will get smaller, and the area of our parallelogram will decrease as well. An interesting product of cross-products is that scalar multiples can get factored out. Our cross product can actually now look like this [image]. This should make intuitive sense as well. The size of our parallelogram gets scaled by the sizes of the changes in u and v. Integrals, of course, are the limit of what happens when things approach zero, so we will take the limit of our sum as du and dv approach 0. This simply becomes [image]. Notice, however, that our "area" represents an area in the uv-plane. not in the xy-plane. We've finally figured out a way to find the surface area of a parametric surface. Keep this idea in mind for later.  </p>
<p> One extra thing I should mention is the special case--that is, functions of x and y. Remember our plane example when we first parameterized a surface? Well, if in our parametric surface we define x = x, y = y, and z = f(x,y), you will end up with the surface area double integral if you find the magnitude of the cross product of partial derivatives of the parametric surface with respect to x and y. Try doing similar things with functions of x and z and y and z as well. </p>
<h2>Surface Integrals over Scalar Fields </h2>  
<p>Back in Chapter 15, we used the double integral of a mass density function, rho(x,y) to find the mass of a lamina on some region in the xy-plane. This, to be honest, felt quite limiting. We then introduced the idea of triple integrals--which would give the mass of some solid bounded by a region when the integrand was a mass-density function. There was one thing that was missing though. What about the mass of a surface? A lamina is a thin plate, but it has to be completely flat. We can't twist it around and use the same calculation! </p>
<p>We just ran into a similar dilemma with surface area. We were lucky enough to have learned a "special case" for function of x and y, but we have nothing for our scenario now. Well, actually, we do have a new tool under our belt: parametric surfaces. Parametric surfaces enable us to turn our surface into a lamina again. How, you might ask? Well, remember, our surface might have a domain in three dimensions--the unit sphere is a trace of the function x^2+y^2+z^2 when f(x,y,z) = 1. When we parameterize our surface, however, our domain is in two dimensions as r(u,v). That means that we can take double integrals of functions of three variables by converting them into functions of two variables. That's something that we know how to do very well. </p>
<p>We'll start with an example: let's find the mass of the unit sphere (so just the surface, not the interior) which has the mass-density function x^2+z^2. We're familiar with this shape due to spherical coordinates, but let's use u and v again. Our parametric surface is thus [image] for u ranging between 0 and 2pi, v ranging between 0 and pi. Now, this is where the magic starts. The first thing we want to do is get everything in terms of the same variable--we did this when we parameterized line integrals. All we're doing is framing our density function in reference to the uv-plane. Since our density function is x^2+z^2, we can substitute our parameterized values for each variable into our equation. This will allow us to basically see what our mass density function is at any input in the uv-plane. For this function, x^2+z^2 = [image]. This is crucial. Notice how our equation only has two input values: u and v. What are our bounds for u and v? We simply have a rectangle where u ranges from 0 to 2pi, v from 0 to pi. This is now a regular double integral problem. All we're doing is finding the area between the surface and the uv-plane. You could also think of it as finding the mass of a rectangular lamina with that mass-density function--like if someone smushed our sphere into that shape. Imagine that the floor is the uv-plane, and that the vertical axis is f(u,v) [image]. We've turned our complicated surface that was our sphere into a simple rectangle, and created a function in the language of this rectangle that represents our mass-density function. Now we're ready to integrate with respect to u and v (the area of our rectangle, or dA). </p>
<p> Or, we're about ready. The astute among you might've noticed a bit of a mistake. The same mistake that you might make when you're introduced to u-substitution and integration by parts (in fact, we could also call a surface integral "uv substitution" if we wanted to)--we switched variables without accounting for how this change would affect our differentials per the chain rule. Recall that we're integrating over the area of our surface this entire time (or at least trying to do something like it), so as odd as it seenms, our original double integral in terms of x and y is over an area, but not an area on the floor, the area of the surface itself. So, we have to go between this small change in surface area and a small change in u and v. Wait a minute, We've already done that! A small change in surface area is equal to a small change in u times a small change in v times the derivative of our surface area function. The surface area function itself is a double integral, so if we twice-differentiate it with respect to u and v, we're left with the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives. This means that altogether, our integral is really [image] </p>
<p>Wow. Let's review that from the top. We wanted to find the mass of a surface, so we decided to integrate our mass-density function. However, because this surface was hard to work in the traditional Cartesian system, we parameterized the mass into a two-dimensional function into a rectangular region according to our new parameterization. To account for this change, we also had to slightly modify our integral to account for the change in variables. We can now write a general equation for this sort of integral. What are we going to call it? Well, remember, we wanted to integrate this functyion over the surface area of some surrface, so we're calling it a surface integral. You can really think of it as turning our surface into a region on the floor, and the function we're integrating into a function of two dimensions. Before moving on, though, there's a couple other things I wanted to talk about. The first is the special case where our surface is lucky enough to be parameterized as a function of x and y, which will give us an equation to find the mass of a surface defined by a function. Well, all we have to do is replace our magnitude of the cross product with the magnitude of a small bit of surface area, and we have our equation [image]. Think of it as integrating our function with respect to the surface. We need to use the chain rule here, however, to integrate over a region of x and y. How do we go from surface area to x and y? Well, a change in total surface area is really approximately the change in the area of our little parallelogram scaled by the change in x and y. The second think that I wanted to mention was what happens when we integrate the function 1 over our surface, and how to interpret it. If we consider replacing f(x,y,z) with 1, we are simply left with the surface area integral. This means that the surrface integral of 1 is simply the surface area, which is analogous to the idea of triple integrating 1 to find volume, or finding the line integral of 1 to find arc length. There's also a nice intuitive way to think about it. Say we have some sort of lamina whose mass-density is 1 g/cm^2 throughout, and the surface area is a total of 100 cm^2. What's the mass going to be? Well, the whole thing is always 1 gram per square centimeter, and if in total it's 100 square centimeters, the mass will be 100 grams. Notice that the mass is equal to the surface area (with a change in units, of course). </p>
<p>Often times, people say that the surface integral is the "3D version" of the line integral. There truly are a lot of similarities. A line integral parameterizes a function along a path to turn a two-dimensional problem into a one-dimensional one. We then had to modify our integral to account for the chain rule. A surface integral parameterizes the thing over which we wish to integrate in order to transform a three-dimensional problem into a two-dimensional one. A line integral is like taking a pice of wire and straightening out to make it easier to work with. A surface integral is like taking a sheet and flattening it.  </p>
<h2> Surface Integrals over Vector Fields </h2>
<p> When we learned line integrals over scalar fields, our first instinct afterwards to see if we could find the amount of work done on an object traveling in a certain path. We then realized that we needed an entire new class of function to even describe this sort of motion: vector fields. It would seem like the next logical thing to ask how to take a surface integral of a vector field. Of course, that's what were about to do, but that seems like a bit of an unnatural way to go about it, doesn't it? After all, if you were a mathematician, there's a chance you would've stumbled across surface integrals before line integrals, so how would you naturally discover surface integrals over vector fields without discovering line integrals? Well, I think the most natural way you could get there is to play around with surfaces--we've freed ourselves from the floor, so what other things can we do with them? We've found the mass of one. I suppose you could find the total amount of heat by integrating a temperature function. You might come to the unconscious conclusion that the things we want to measure can all be accomplished when the surface is standing still. What if, though, the surface was still, but the things around it were not? You've probably seen something like this before--a fluid flow simulation. When people build airplanes, they have to make sure the parts can all withstand air or other fluids constantly being hurled at them without falling apart. So, how do you measure how much wear and tear you're putting the airplane wing through? Think about it this way--what does more damage to the wing: a little bit of fluid over a long period of time, or a ton of fluid in a short period of time? Clearly the latter. So, we want to measure this fluid flow in mass per unit time, so kilograms per second. This value is known as flux. It isn't too hard to measure the total flux of an object if it's simple in shape, like a square, and if the fluid is moving through it evenly. However, more often than not, your surface will have a complicated shape, and these fluid won't be attacking the surface in the same direction or with the same strength. If, however, we could find the flux in small regions throughout the surface and add them all together, we could come up with our flux. Of course, adding lots of tiny things together is the chief business of the integral. Doing it across a surface is the job of the surface integral.</p>
<p>So the new thing to do is integrating a vector field across a surface. The first question that should jump at you is "what does that even mean?" When we did line integrals, we had to clarify that we were taking a dot product of our vector field with dr, which was why our notation was different. What sorts of calculations are we going to do this time? Well, we ultimately want to know how much fluid (which we'll imagine as water) is going through a small area. How do we do this? Well, let's imagine a very simple case at first and think about what causes how much liquid to flow through an area. Suppose we have a small patch on our surface which comes in contact with our water flow vector. How will the position of the vector relative to the surface affect the fluid flow? Let's think of two extreme examples. Firstly, imagine that the fluid flow is directly tangent to the area. How much fluid will flow through it? Zero. At this point, none of the water is actually going through our little because itr's traveling alongside it. Imagine this was a hose where the water was shooting out right next to the surface, barely enough to reach the surface, and shooting right past it. Now, how would you aim the hose if you wanted the most water to flow through it? Well, you'd aim your hose straight at the surface. This is the other extreme example. It seems that the total flux of our surface will depend on how strong the fluid flow is in the direction of our surface at every point. </p>
<p>How will we measure this? Strength of the hose aside, this clearly depends ont he direction of our water vector, which means we need something to do with an angle, possibly? What we want to do is figure out how much of the fluid flow goes into the direction of the surface. In other words, we need to know the strength of the component of our flow vector that goes directly into our surface. Hmm, "amount" of a vector that goes in a particular direction. This sounds familiar. Indeed it is. Way back in Chapter 12, we learned about vector projection and scalar projection. By finding the projection between two vectors, we can find the component (or the strength of the component) of one vector which travels in the direction of the other, which is precisely what we need. There's a problem, though. We have a vector for the fluid flow (that will end up being our vector field in the end as you can imagine), but with respect to what vector are we taking the component? Well, it's some sort of vector that shoots straight out of our patch. Right out. The maximum angular distance that two vectors can be apart on the same side of a surface is 90 degrees, so we need a vector that's 90 degrees away from the surface of the patch--in other words, a normal vector. Of course, if we want a vector normal to a surface, then we should take the cross product with respect to the partial derivatives of our parametric surface. Why? These vectors represent tangency to the surface, and so are the best approximation of the surface at a point. A vector that passes through the surface compeltely would be normal to both of these. So, if we want to know the amount of the fluid that is flowing in the direction normal to the surface, we should take the scalar projection of the fluid onto the surface. The best normal vector to use here is the unit normal vector. Why? Well, remember what the formula for scalar projection is. [image] The denominator is the magnitude of our normal vector, which, if it's one, means that the strength of the component is simply the dot product. So it looks like just like we did with like line integrals, we're going to have to integrate dot products across a surface. So, we're going to add up the dot products between the flow vector and the normal vector. Here's the problem though: our vector field is in terms of x, y, and z, while our surface is parametrically defined in terms of u and v. Here's the thing--we only care about the vectors which make contact with our surface, meaning we can parametrically define our vector field. This will define the components in terms of u and v. Of course, since u and v mark out the domain of our surface, only vectors along our surface will remain, but that's okay, because we only care about the ones directly touching it to see how much is going through.</p>
<p>What do we have to do now? Well, once we've taken the dot product, we're actually left with a scalar-valued function, all in terms of u and v. However, we've once again gone from integrating over the area of a surface to integrating over the area of a region, meaning we will have to multiply by the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives and dA, which represents our scaled surface area vectors' magnitude. There's some nice cancellation here--specifically, the magnitudes of the vectors end up cancelling out, leaving us with just [image]. This actually has a very beautiful geometric interpretation. Look what we're doing in our integrand: we're finding the cross product of two vectors, and then taking the dot product with a third. Do you remember what this is an example of? It's a triple product, which represents the volume of a parallelepiped. Here's the thing about math--whenever something geometric appears, it's never due to coincidence. So, what exactly are we finding the volume of here? Well, the base of the parallelepiped is marked by the two partial derivatives. The height depends on vector field. In either case, this volume represents the actual amount of water that has gone through our surface, scaled by some time delta t, since our flux vector is related to velocity.. For any given period of time, a larger volume created by this parallelepiped corresponds to a larger volume of water. You might be wondering: "Hold on. When did time matter at all in our equation?" Well, we can say that the total flow is equal to the rate of increase of the volume of water (flux) multiplied by time. Dividing both sides by time, we get that the rate of change of the total amount of water with respect to time is equal to flux. (It's worth noting here, integrating flux across a surface is not with respect to time, so we're not actually finding how much water fills a space in a certain amount of time--seems somewhat strange since we're used to integrals of rates giving us accumulation)</p>
<p>Just like we did with line integrals, in order to take a surface integral across some surface, we had to take a dot product between our vector field and our surface, which turned into a surface integral on a scalar field, which became a regular double integral over a parametric domain.</p>
