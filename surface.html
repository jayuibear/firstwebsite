<h1> Surface Integrals </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> The interesting part about line integrals was the fact that we were able to import the idea of single integrals into three dimensions by creating a "directional integral" of sorts. We created a path in our input space to follow along. Now, though, we're going to take it one step further.</p>
<h2> Parametric Surfaces </h2>
<p> I'm going to ask a question whose answer we already know, and then look at it from a different perspective. How do you find the surface area of some surface in 3 dimensions? </p>
<p> We learned in chapter 15 that this is simlpy a double integral over some region where our integrand was [image] How would you find the surface area of a more complex surface like a sphere? This can't be represented as a function of x and y. You still could add up two surface area integrals, but think about how inconvenient this would be in this situation [image] or for a curve that looks like this </p>
