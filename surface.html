<h1> Surface Integrals </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Have you ever seen one of those simulations of an airplane wing being put into wind? Like this [image] How would you describe the air moving around this? We've added line integrals to our toolbelt, but the point of those was to see how a vector field acted along some sort of path. This time, though, we need some sort of tool that lets us describe an entire shape. </p>
<h2> Parametric Surfaces </h2>
<p> Well, there shouldn't be anything too new. We've dealt with surfaces many times before, as functions of x and y. Here's the problem though. Lots of surfaces and objects in real life aren't that forgiving. If you have a sheet of metal or some sort of screw, chances are it's going to fold over itself, or you need to find properties about vectors against the surface in case that it does. So, the question is, how do we define these sorts of surfaces? </p>
<p> You could try defining them implicitly.
