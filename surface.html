<h1> Surface Integrals </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> The interesting part about line integrals was the fact that we were able to import the idea of single integrals into three dimensions by creating a "directional integral" of sorts. We created a path in our input space to follow along. Now, though, we're going to take it one step further.</p>
<h2> Parametric Surfaces and Surface Area </h2>
<p> I'm going to ask a question whose answer we already know, and then look at it from a different perspective. How do you find the surface area of some surface in 3 dimensions? </p>
<p> We learned in chapter 15 that this is simlpy a double integral over some region where our integrand was [image] How would you find the surface area of a more complex surface like a sphere? This can't be represented as a function of x and y. You still could add up two surface area integrals of hemispheres, but think about how inconvenient this would be in this situation [image] or for a surface that looks like this </p>
<p> The problem here, similar to the one we faced when we derived the idea of line integrals, is the fact that we're trying to do something that requires 3 variables when we're used to doing it in two. When it came to line integrals, we had to do something in two variables when we only wanted one. Back then, we tried creating a sort of "directional integral", and what is our objective now?</p>
<p> You can almost think of this as a "directional double integral" in that we're no longer just concerned with what's on the floor--we want to go in many different directions up and down according to our surface. Ideally, we'd even want to somehow integrate across the surface itself. Imagine how easy that would be! </p> 
<p> But anyway, the task here is to describe a surface that needs three variables (well, sort of, we can't visualize f(x,y,z) in scalar fields very well, but it's obvious that two inputs of f(x,y) are not enough) in two variables. How should we go about doing this? Once again, the easiest idea is to simplify our problem. What should we do in the two dimensional case? When we needed to represent a path in space with one variable, we parameterized x and y with some third variable t. What should we do in this case? Well, we definitely can't only use one variable because that would be a path--how would you create that weird tangled mess of a sheet using only a path? </p>
<p> So once again we've narrowed the solution down to parameterization, but what do we need to do specifically? Well, let's think of a surface that's a lot simpler to describe in 3D to approach our answer: planes. We've worked with planes and parametric equations before--specifically, with vectors. If you recall, we identified a plane as a dot product which satisfies the following equation: [image] </p>
<p> How are we going to parameterize this? Well, recall that when we first learned about planes, we learned that one vector parallel to the plane isn't enough-we needed two vectors of which we took the cross product, which meant that we couldn't parametrically define a plane using one variable. It might be rather intuitive, then, that a parametric representation of a plane will require two variables. You might be tempted to use s and t. We will conventionally use u and v. So how will we use u and v to describe this plane? It's actually a lot easier than you might think, so easy that this will probably be redundantly confusing. We will use three functions, x(u,v), y(u,v), and z(u,v) to describe our surface. Again, remember the intuitive reason why we have to use two variables. To describe a path, you can use one, but what if you wanted to describe a sheet, like your bedsheets? You can't just say that the length is 7 feet. You also have to specify the width. Any surface requires two variables to describe its shape. </p>
<p> Okay, so are you ready for our parameterization? Well, here it is: [image]. Yeah, I know what you're thinking--we already knew that. We already knew that z was equivalent to that quantity (substituting x and y for u and v). In fact, why did we have to use u and v at all? We already knew how to describe this surface. However, look at we just did. We successfully described each coordinate of our surface using two variables despite it existing in three dimensions. This was our goal the entire time. Let's use the example of a sphere instead to make this a lot more easy and practical to understand. </p>
<p> Being able to parameterize a sphere is something that could actually come in handy (though there will be special cases of formulas down the line where z is a function of x and y which make calculations a lot simpler). How would we parametrically represent a sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin? If we were given a circle of radius 2 in 2 demensions, our only variable left would our angle, determining our x and y values based on trigonometric functions. Recall that a sphere is comprised of two angles: one on the floor, and one on the vertical axis. Do you remember what we learned from the section on spherical coordinates? These were the formulas for x, y, and z: [image] </p>
<p> We know that our radius is 2 in this case, so we can replace all values of rho with 2. All we are left with, then, is [image], which we can rewrite as [image], parametrically defined as a function of theta and phi. You can replace theta and phi with u and v and get the exact same result. This might be surprising at first, since we said that theta and phi specifically represent angles. But remember, they are simply variables--values which take some sort of input which we successfully interpret some way. This entire time we've been using a parametrically defined surface without realizing it!</p>
<p> Okay, let's look back again since we got a little bit distracted. What were we trying to do? We wanted to find the surcae area of some parametric surface. We've been able to parameterize these surfaces in 3D, but what now? Well, let's think about what we have to do and compare it to what we did back when we found the surface area of surfaces that were functions of x and y. In sum, what we want to do is sum the areas of a bunch of parallelograms on our surface. As we get more and more parallelograms, this sum approaches the true surface area. Our parallelograms change in size on different parts of our surface, which we represented as changing partial derivatives. We used the fact that the area of these parallelograms were found by finding the magnitude of the cross product of these two partial derivatives. We essentially want to do something similar this time--go across our entire surface and add up the areas of parallelograms. The problem, though, is that we no longer have a function of x and y. We have three functions of u and v which represent our surface. What do we do? </p>
<p> Ask yourself what we did when we found the surface area for a function of x and y. It's a lie to say that we integrated over our surface--we integrated over a region on our floor which marked our input space. So, you can logically assume that this time we also need to integrate over a region in our input space, only that our input space is in the uv-plane, not the xy-plane. We run into a problem real fast, though, which is that we don't want to deal with three functions. Our parametric function will be in vector form. This will also make the cross-product part easier down the line, as you might be able to imagine. Anyway, the surface area of our surface will be over some region in this new set of coordinates u and v. Remember, what's a rectangle in the uv-plane may be a totally different shape in Cartesian coordinates. Take the example of a sphere like we just saw earlier. Theta and phi lie on a "spherical rectangle" which in the theta phi plane would look like this [image]. On the other hand, what looks like a rectangular or box in three dimensions may be an extremely odd-looking shape in the uv-plane</p>
<p> What we need to do now is create a parallelogram. So let's zoom in on a little patch of our surface and look specifically at the corner. Obviously, our patch is a bit curved in Cartesian space, which we expected. However, we're going to approximate the area of this patch with a parallelogram. Remember, we need two vectors. Specifiaclly, we need to find two vectors that are tangent to the surface and then find the cross product. These vectors were our partial derivatives when we dealt with functions of x and y. What will they be this time? Let's think about why we used partial derivatives in the first place for this task. Their usefulness came from the fact that one variable was always treated as constant. That is, we could travel along our path in the x direction and describe the approximate slope, and travel along our path in the y direction and describe our approximate slope. In other words, we can describe the behavior of our entire surface by attacking it from two different directions--one along the side of one axis, and the other from that of the other axis, which would give us a tangent plane, the 3-dimensional equivalent of linearization in point-slope form from Calc I. With our parametrically-defined surface, however, our directions are no longer x and y--they are now u and v. Let's look at what happens when we hold u and v constant for some shape, say a sphere of radius 2.  </p>
<p> I've selected the point (1,1,root2) which lies directly on our sphere. We know how to convert from rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates and vice vera. I've called theta and phi u and v respectively in this case. It turns out both of our angles are pi/4, so we'll hold u and v cosntant at pi/4. This is our result: </p>
<p>Just like we did with functions of x and y, we once again approach our point from two different directions. It looks strange since our paths are circular, but just remember that our approach looks like zooming in on a rectangle in the uv-plane. So how are we going to represent area? We're going to need derivatives in some sense to represent tangent planes, but they will now be the partial derivatives with respect to u and v instead of x and y. The parallelogram formed by these tangent vectors will approximately look like one that represents a small patch on our sphere. You might have caught onto something that's a bit different this time, though. We're dealing with a vector-valued function, not a scalar one. We faced this issue with line integrals as well. Remember, if we find the derivative of a vector-valued parametric functyion, we find the derivatives of each directional component (this is like seeing how x, y, and z, will change for a small nudge in our parameter). The same logic holds for partials. We will take the partial derivartives with respect to r and u for each component of our vector. The point of seeing the "traces" on the sphere was to see that partial derivatives still make sense for parametrically defined surfaces as two ways to approach a point in R3. We now have to actually compute the partial derivatives, which are [image] </p>
<p>Let's construct a tangent plane at our point by plotting the two vectors at our point in the uv-plane, (pi/4, pi/4). [image] </p>
<p>Okay, we're almost done. The only problem here is that we haven't specified the area of our parallelogram--right now we have a plane that extends infinitely. No problem--all we have to do is take the magnitude of our cross product. However, we haven't specified how small our changes in u or v are. We will once again use the idea of the differential, which is that we can represent a small change in our output by a small change in our input times a derivative. In other words, we multiply our partial derivatives on both sides by delta u or delta v, and get that our small resulting vector (remember, this is a vector-calued function) is equal to our partial derivative vector evaluated at some point (u,v) times our small change in u or v. As our small change in u and v gets smaller, the size of our resultant vectors will get smaller, and the area of our parallelogram will decrease as well. An interesting product of cross-products is that scalar multiples can get factored out. Our cross product can actually now look like this [image]. This should make intuitive sense as well. The size of our parallelogram gets scaled by the sizes of the changes in u and v. Integrals, of course, are the limit of what happens when things approach zero, so we will take the limit of our sum as du and dv approach 0. This simply becomes [image]. Notice, however, that our "area" represents an area in the uv-plane. not in the xy-plane. We've finally figured out a way to find the surface area of a parametric surface. Keep this idea in mind for later.  </p>
