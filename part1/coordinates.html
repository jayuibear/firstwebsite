<h1>Coordinates in Three Dimensions</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have read/heard several math professors call multivariable calculus a market of mathematical maturity. The reason for that, I believe, is because of all of the new crazy things that get introduced when you add another variable to the mix. You have to use new types of functions and new representations of them, and getting a hang of that will help you become a better math student. But, of course, we have to start at the basics, since we're redefining even the core aspects. Up until now, we've been very familiar with representing functions with graphs in the xy-plane. Now, however, we're going to be looking at functions that require two, sometimes even more, inputs. If two of our coordinates are used up for inputs, then we're going to need a third one for our output. </p>
<h2>Putting Some Rigor Into Basic Cartesian Space</h2>
<p>For our entire mathematical lives, we've always followed this simple rule: the coordinate axis that goes from left to right is the x-axis, and the one that goes up and down is the y-axis. Before we shatter our world an go any further, though, I am going to lay down some concrete rules about the 2D Cartesian coordinate system in order to get you really thinking about something that's been in your mathematical intuition this whole time. That way, the transition between 2D and 3D coordinates becomes easier. So, I want to ask a question. If I gave you a point on the xy-plane, say, (3,4), what does that mean? What exactly is 3, and what is 4? This might seem like a dumb question. After all, all it means that is that if I were to graph this point, starting from the origin, I count three to the right, and then four up. I'm asking for, however, a more geometric reasoning. Thinking about Cartesian space in any sense always makes the most sense when you do it geometrically. So, what does (3,4) tell you geometrically? Well, 3 and 4 both represent distances. The point (3,4) is 3 units from the x-axis and 4 units from the y-axis, or so I always have myself believe. Of course, I really have it backwards. (3,4) really means our point is 3 units to the right of the y-axis and 4 units above the x-axis. It's a bit of confusing, just like the fact that the y-intercept is when x = 0 and the x-intercept is when y = 0. Anyway, that gives us a moer concrete definition of what a point (x,y) actually means geometrically (while nothing I offer here is rigorous, it should be a bit more rigorous then "go right 3 and then up 4"). The second thing I want to ask, is actually something that for the sake of constructing a coordinate system from scratch, I should've asked before my first question. However, given how familiar you are with coordinates already, I think this is the one that would come to you next if you gave coordinates some serious thought. That is, in which directions to the axes go, positive and negative? Again, this seems like a really stupid question. We already know that x is horizontal and that right is positive. y is vertical and up is positive. Okay, what if I gave you this x-axis then. Where would you put the y-axis? </p> [image here]
<p>Well, you'd put your y-axis here, right?</p> [image here]
<p>How did you know to put it there? Well, we first of all have established that our coordinate axes are prependicular, so we know how to preserve the general shape. Then, we just poke the y-axis up and through the origin like that, and we can rotate our axes back into the default position. You can imagine that if was a piece of paper, you could rotate it so that the x-axis is parallel to the horizontal direction of your desk. Or, you could just tilt your head to restore the image to its default position. Either way, you rotate it back into place. Let's look back at our first requirement, though. The coordiante axes are perpendicular, so what's stopping us from writing our axes like this? </p> [image here] 
<p>We've just established that in order for the axes to be correct, you have to be able to rotate it back into the default position with the positive x pointing to the right and the positive y pointing up. Here's the thing: you won't be able to do it. Really, give it a try. This isn't a valid configuration.</p>
<p>This gives us a system that allows us to put together a makeshift coordinate grid no matter where our axes are. Imagine you're given this as the positive x-axis:</p> [image here]
<p>What direcrtion would the positive y-axis face? Give it a try for yourself, and click here [link here] to find out if you're correct. Remember, it's all about rotating it back into position.</p>
<p>At this point, you might think it's a bit of a pain in the butt to have to rotate your device, paper, or head every time you want to figure out where the axes go. What if, instead, we devised a system to help us do it instead? Besides being useful for practical reasons, this would allow us to generalize the xy-plane to any shape as long as the axes are prependicular and it's following the conventions. We'd want something that basically lets us track the rotation. Something that we could use geometrically that lets us say "okay, if we place our positive x-axis here, the positive y goes this way." You might be used to rotating your head at this point, so what's the easiest thing to use as a rotateable coordinate axis in front of your head? We need something that can constantly display an x and y axis which we can manipulate. In pretty un-mathematical seeming way, we're actually going to be using our right hand.</p>
<p>I'm going to demonstrate this with my actual right hand. Have your palm face you and close all of your fingers except for your index finger and thumb which you will extend out like so. Your thumb will become the x-axis and the index finger will be the y-axis: </p> [image here]
<p>Now, try rotating your hand a little bit counterclockwise. Notice that you end up with the situation in our first example where the x-axis was slightly tilted. Since all of your fingers move with your hand, when you rotate your thumb a little bit counterclockwise, your index finger also goes a bit counterclockwise. If you rotate your hand enough, you can see what happens when the x-axis is facing down and to the left. You can rotate your hand back into the default position to make sure that it works. [link here] The system we've created is known as the right-hand rule.</p>
<p>So, we've established how to define points in our space and the positioning of their boundaries. In effecy, this is really all we need for our coordinate system to work. However, there is one more thing that comes very much in handy when it comes to Cartesian coordinates, and that's specifying what part of the coordinate plane a point or curve is located, also known as quadrants. The idea is pretty basic; the fact that there are two perpendicular lines that intersect at a point divides our plane into four equal regions. We know the order: Quadrant 1 in the top right, 2 in the top left, and so on. The problem, though, is that now that we've established our right-hand rule, directions are simply relative. We're going to need a more mathematical definition. So, if we imagine that the coordinate axes act as boundaries for our quadrants, what does each axis actually act as a boundary for? What happens to a moving point as it passes through the x-axis or the y-axis? Well, if a moving point goes from the left part of the y-axis to the right part, the x value goes from negative to positive. If a moving point goes from below the x-axis to above, the y-value goes from negative to positive. Therefore, we can say that each quadrant just gives information about the sign of the x and y value. In Quadrant I, both x and y are positive. In Quadrant 2, x is negative while y is positive. In Quadrant 3, both x and y are negative, and finally, in Quadrant 4, x is positive but y is negative. </p>
<h2>Three-Dimensional Cartesian Coordinates</h2>
<p>As you may know, space in our world is in three dimensions, which is hard to represent on a two-dimensional surface. We can model so many different types of surfaces and paths that we never could before if there was a rigorous coordinate system to do so. We will now introduce Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Let's first look at the most natural way to form these coordinates. We're going to add a third coordinate axis on top of the two that we already have. So, if you have an xy-plane laying on a piece of paper on your desk, imagine drawing a new axis that penetrates the paper, putting the xy-plane on the floor, basically. Alternatively, if your xy-plane is on a screen or board that is facing you, the new axis will penetrate through the screen or board towards or away from you. We will, of course, call this axis the z-axis.</p>
<p>We need to define the two basic things we need in the coordinate system. Firstly, how to represent points and what their values mean. Points in three-dimensional space are represented as (x,y,z). So, if I have the point (3,4,5), what do each of those numbers mean? First of all, let's look at that point. But, in order to do that, we're going to want to choose a way to orient our coordinates. In a traditional two dimensional Cartesian plane, we generally elect to draw the first Quadrant, or the part where x and y are both positive. Positive numbers are just nicer to work with. So, the most common configuration in xyz-space is to have all three coordinate values be positive. What will this look like? Well, we'll develop a three-dimensional right-hand rule system just like we did for two dimensions later, but for now, let's just walk it through. Starting with our first intuition, imagine that the gray plane at the bottom represents a sheet of paper. Drawn on it is the x-axis in red and the y-axis in green. The blue z-axis passes up and down through it perpendicularly. </p>
