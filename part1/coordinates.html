<h1>Coordinates in Three Dimensions</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have read/heard several math professors call multivariable calculus a marker of mathematical maturity. The reason for that, I believe, is because of all of the new crazy things that get introduced when you add another variable to the mix. You have to use new types of functions and new representations of them, and getting a hang of that will help you become a better math student. But, of course, we have to start at the basics, since we're redefining even the core aspects. Up until now, we've been very familiar with representing functions with graphs in the xy-plane. Now, however, we're going to be looking at functions that require two, sometimes even more, inputs. If two of our coordinates are used up for inputs, then we're going to need a third one for our output. </p>
<h2>Putting Some Rigor Into Basic Cartesian Space</h2>
<p>For our entire mathematical lives, we've always followed this simple rule: the coordinate axis that goes from left to right is the x-axis, and the one that goes up and down is the y-axis. Before we shatter our world an go any further, though, I am going to lay down some concrete rules about the 2D Cartesian coordinate system in order to get you really thinking about something that's been in your mathematical intuition this whole time. That way, the transition between 2D and 3D coordinates becomes easier. So, I want to ask a question. If I gave you a point on the xy-plane, say, (3,4), what does that mean? What exactly is 3, and what is 4? This might seem like a dumb question. After all, all it means that is that if I were to graph this point, starting from the origin, I count three to the right, and then four up. I'm asking for, however, a more geometric reasoning. Thinking about Cartesian space in any sense always makes the most sense when you do it geometrically. So, what does (3,4) tell you geometrically? Well, 3 and 4 both represent distances. The point (3,4) is 3 units from the x-axis and 4 units from the y-axis, or so I always have myself believe. Of course, I really have it backwards. (3,4) really means our point is 3 units to the right of the y-axis and 4 units above the x-axis. It's a bit of confusing, just like the fact that the y-intercept is when x = 0 and the x-intercept is when y = 0. Anyway, that gives us a moer concrete definition of what a point (x,y) actually means geometrically (while nothing I offer here is rigorous, it should be a bit more rigorous then "go right 3 and then up 4"). The second thing I want to ask, is actually something that for the sake of constructing a coordinate system from scratch, I should've asked before my first question. However, given how familiar you are with coordinates already, I think this is the one that would come to you next if you gave coordinates some serious thought. That is, in which directions to the axes go, positive and negative? Again, this seems like a really stupid question. We already know that x is horizontal and that right is positive. y is vertical and up is positive. Okay, what if I gave you this x-axis then. Where would you put the y-axis? </p> <img src="3dcoord2vfuncimg/tiltedx.png">
<p>Well, you'd put your y-axis here, right?</p> <img src="3dcoord2vfuncimg/tiltedxy.png">
<p>How did you know to put it there? Well, we first of all have established that our coordinate axes are prependicular, so we know how to preserve the general shape. Then, we just poke the y-axis up and through the origin like that, and we can rotate our axes back into the default position. You can imagine that if was a piece of paper, you could rotate it so that the x-axis is parallel to the horizontal direction of your desk. Or, you could just tilt your head to restore the image to its default position. Either way, you rotate it back into place. Let's look back at our first requirement, though. The coordiante axes are perpendicular, so what's stopping us from writing our axes like this? </p> <img src="3dcoord2vfuncimg/tiltedxywrong.png"> 
<p>We've just established that in order for the axes to be correct, you have to be able to rotate it back into the default position with the positive x pointing to the right and the positive y pointing up. Here's the thing: you won't be able to do it. Really, give it a try. This isn't a valid configuration.</p>
<p>This gives us a system that allows us to put together a makeshift coordinate grid no matter where our axes are. Imagine you're given this as the positive x-axis:</p> <img src="3dcoord2vfuncimg/weirdtiltedx.png">
<p>What direcrtion would the positive y-axis face? Give it a try for yourself, and <a href="3dcoord2vfuncimg/weirdtiltedxy.png">click here</a> to find out if you're correct. Remember, it's all about rotating it back into position.</p>
<p>At this point, you might think it's a bit of a pain in the butt to have to rotate your device, paper, or head every time you want to figure out where the axes go. What if, instead, we devised a system to help us do it instead? Besides being useful for practical reasons, this would allow us to generalize the xy-plane to any shape as long as the axes are prependicular and it's following the conventions. We'd want something that basically lets us track the rotation. Something that we could use geometrically that lets us say "okay, if we place our positive x-axis here, the positive y goes this way." You might be used to rotating your head at this point, so what's the easiest thing to use as a rotateable coordinate axis in front of your head? We need something that can constantly display an x and y axis which we can manipulate. In pretty un-mathematical seeming way, we're actually going to be using our right hand.</p>
<p>I'm going to demonstrate this with my actual right hand. Have your palm face you and close all of your fingers except for your index finger and thumb which you will extend out like so. Your thumb will become the x-axis and the index finger will be the y-axis: </p> <img src="3dcoord2vfuncimg/rhr2d.png">
<p>Now, try rotating your hand a little bit counterclockwise. Notice that you end up with the situation in our first example where the x-axis was slightly tilted. Since all of your fingers move with your hand, when you rotate your thumb a little bit counterclockwise, your index finger also goes a bit counterclockwise. If you rotate your hand enough, you can see what happens when the x-axis is facing down and to the left. You can rotate your hand back into the default position to make sure that it works. <a href="3dcoord2vfuncimg/rhr2dtilt.png">See here.</a> The system we've created is known as the right-hand rule.</p>
<p>So, we've established how to define points in our space and the positioning of their boundaries. In effecy, this is really all we need for our coordinate system to work. However, there is one more thing that comes very much in handy when it comes to Cartesian coordinates, and that's specifying what part of the coordinate plane a point or curve is located, also known as quadrants. The idea is pretty basic; the fact that there are two perpendicular lines that intersect at a point divides our plane into four equal regions. We know the order: Quadrant 1 in the top right, 2 in the top left, and so on. The problem, though, is that now that we've established our right-hand rule, directions are simply relative. We're going to need a more mathematical definition. So, if we imagine that the coordinate axes act as boundaries for our quadrants, what does each axis actually act as a boundary for? What happens to a moving point as it passes through the x-axis or the y-axis? Well, if a moving point goes from the left part of the y-axis to the right part, the x value goes from negative to positive. If a moving point goes from below the x-axis to above, the y-value goes from negative to positive. Therefore, we can say that each quadrant just gives information about the sign of the x and y value. In Quadrant I, both x and y are positive. In Quadrant 2, x is negative while y is positive. In Quadrant 3, both x and y are negative, and finally, in Quadrant 4, x is positive but y is negative. </p>
<h2>Three-Dimensional Cartesian Coordinates</h2>
<p>As you may know, space in our world is in three dimensions, which is hard to represent on a two-dimensional surface. We can model so many different types of surfaces and paths that we never could before if there was a rigorous coordinate system to do so. We will now introduce Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Let's first look at the most natural way to form these coordinates. We're going to add a third coordinate axis on top of the two that we already have. So, if you have an xy-plane laying on a piece of paper on your desk, imagine drawing a new axis that penetrates the paper, putting the xy-plane on the floor, basically. Alternatively, if your xy-plane is on a screen or board that is facing you, the new axis will penetrate through the screen or board towards or away from you. We will, of course, call this axis the z-axis.</p>
<p>We need to define the two basic things we need in the coordinate system. Firstly, how to represent points and what their values mean. Points in three-dimensional space are represented as (x,y,z). So, if I have the point (3,4,5), what do each of those numbers mean? First of all, let's look at that point. But, in order to do that, we're going to want to choose a way to orient our coordinates. In a traditional two dimensional Cartesian plane, we generally elect to draw the first Quadrant, or the part where x and y are both positive. Positive numbers are just nicer to work with. So, the most common configuration in xyz-space is to have all three coordinate values be positive. What will this look like? Well, we'll develop a three-dimensional right-hand rule system just like we did for two dimensions later, but for now, let's just walk it through.</p> <img src="3dcoord2vfuncimg/3dcoords.html">
<p> Starting with our first intuition, imagine that the gray plane at the bottom represents a sheet of paper. Drawn on it is the x-axis in red and the y-axis in green. The blue z-axis passes up and down through it perpendicularly. This is basically like looking at an xy-plane from above at a slight angle so we can see the z-axis. Okay, so we want to create a view where x, y, and z are all positive. Well, we know that x and y are positive in the first quadrant. Z is positive going up. Therefore, we want to be looking at the portion in what would normally be in the first quadrant above our gray paper, or the area above the gray portion <a href="3dcoord2vfuncimg/3dcoordsdemo.png">here</a>. Now, we need to imagine twisting our perspective so that our eyes are looking at the origin from this space where all three coordinates are positive, which ends up looking like this: </p> [image here]
<p>Before moving on, let's talk about structure. We had quadrants with our xy-plane, and we still basically have quadrants, except now we can either have z be positive or negative. That means that every quadrant has two options, which brings us up to eight octants. The space where all three coordinate values are positive is called the first octant, and a lot of our time will be spent picturing things in this part of our coordinate system. Just like with the xy-plane, we also tend to restrict our perspective to just the first octant. This is luckily very easy to draw, as all you have to do is make three lines like so:</p> [image here]
<p> Alright, so back to (3,4,5). Again, we'll start with the intuitive idea of just "following along" each axis by the value of each coordinate. We go three across on the x-axis, four across on y, and five up. Our resulting point looks something like this. </p> [image here]
<p>Once again, this idea of creating coordinates like this makes sense, but it isn't so rigorous. So, let's ask ourselves. What does the value 3 in (3,4,5) mean? Well, in the two-dimensional point (3,4), the number 3 represented a distance of 3 away from the y-axis. So, does 3 in (3,4,5) represent a distance of 3 away from the y-axis as well? Let's think about this. We need to look at all possible points such that x = 3. On the flat xy-plane, we're used to seeing this: </p> [image here]
<p>Well, our point (3,4,5) doesn't lie on this line. Why? In our two-dimensional case, y could be any value as long as x was 3. However, we also have the z-axis now. In other words, in our new coordinate space, y and z can be anything as long as x = 3. This definitely means that our point isn't necessarily 3 units away from the y-axis. I mean, imagine a point like (3,4,10000000). That would be really high up, so the distance from the y-axis would be very far. We were used to our point (3,4), which does lie on our line on the floor if z = 0. However, z can be anything now, so you can imagine stacking a bunch of these lines on top of each other to create a "sheet" which represents x = 3, which we'll view along with our point (3,4,5).</p> [image here]
<p>So we've established that x = 3 creates this sheet at an x-value of 3, but we still haven't actually answered the question of what the value of 3 means. Well, let's look at our graph once more from a different angle. </p> [image here]
<p>Alright, so it looks like our sheet is parallel to another sheet that goes through the y-axis, no? That is, the sheet x = 0.</p> [image here]
<p>And if we look at any point on our sheet x = 3, we will see that it is 3 units directly to the left of our new sheet at x = 0. </p> [image here]
<p>We've narrowed ourselves down to the answer: an x value represents the distance from the sheet that passes directly along the y-axis. We need some terminology, here. First of all, "sheet" isn't what they're actually called. They're called planes. So, we could say that "x = 3" is really "the plane x = 3". Secondly, there's something special about the plane x = 0. It represents a wall created by our coordinate axes. If we're looking at our first octant, it's on of the three planes that marks it up--there's one on the floor, and two on the sides. They actually all have names. Remember, when we looked at functions on the xy-plane, those are functions that only exist on the floor, which we assume to be z = 0. We basically ignore z. Now, what a bout a function where we ignore x, where we assume x to be 0? In other words, a function that is plastered onto this new mystery plane like this, for example:  </p> [image here]
<p>You can imagine that this curve takes y-values as inputs and outputs z-values, disregarding x. Well, we've seen that functions of x which output y-values fall on the xy-plane because they disregard z-values. Here, we are disregarding the x-values but only care about the values y and z. Therefore, the plane x = 0 is really the yz-plane (you probably have figured this out by now, but the plane z = 0 is the xy-plane). You can also think about it as, imagine we lived in another world where instead of first learning coordinates with a plane made of x and y, you started with a plane made of y and z, the yz-plane. Then, one day, in your yz world, you're introduced to a three-dimensional coordinate system and are told that a new axis called the x-axis exists that we've been disregarding before. Well, all of your old functions in two dimensions just happened on the yz-plane/wall. Same idea. </p>
<p>Now we know that an x value represents a distance away from the yz-plane. A y value, which was 4 in our case of (3,4,5) would thus represent a distance of 4 away from the plane y = 0, which passes directly along the x-axis like so:</p> [image here]
<p>Just like with our previous example, a curve on the plane y = 0 takes in inputs of x and outputs values of z while disregarding y-values. Therefore, this plane is the xz-plane. y-values are simply distances away from the xz-plane.</p>
<p>Finally, what does the z-value represent? This should actually be the easiest one to answer since we're already used to functions that disregard z, and now we're just adding it in. Put simply, the z-value is the distance from the floor--it's the height of our point. The floor is, of course, the xy-plane. </p>
<p>When we put all of these three facts together, the distance from each boundary plane, we can define our point. The point (3,4,5) is the point in place such that its distance from the yz-plane is 3, its distance from the xz-plane is 4, and its distance from the xy-plane is 5. Here's [link here] a concise visualization. As you can see, all three planes intersect at our point, which themselves are a certain distance from the boundary planes marked by the coordiante itself. Pretty neat, huh?</p>
<h2>Developing a Right-Hand Rule for Three Dimensions</h2>
<p>We've established how to define a point in space in three dimensions. However, we have not defined how our three axes are defined with respect to each other. We've already seen a bit of an issue with this. We had to rotate our perspective depending on whether or not we wanted our z-axis pointing directly at us if our xy-plane was on a screen facing us, or if we wanted it going up and down if our xy-plane was on a piece of paper on our desk. Furthermore, we had to rotate our perspective to view our first octant. This can all be very disorienting in three-dimensions because it's so hard to visualize. I mean, for example, let's say that I give you the x-axis as going this way, where should I put the y-axis? </p> [image here]
<p>Well, the only restriction so far is that the x-axis and the y-axis are perpendicular. So, I guess, I can put the y-axis here.</p> [image here]
<p>We're basically making our first octant here, right? If that's the case, we can see that our z-axis would poke up like this.</p> [image here]
<p>Here's the thing. What was stopping me from putting my y-axis here</p> [image here]
<p>Or here [link here] or here [link here]? In three dimensions, there's actually a lot of options for making two things perpendicular to each other. We can imagine this as the xy-portion of our first octant being rotated in all sorts of ways, and then we have to add a z-axis. You see, the real restriction in the three-dimensional case is on the z-axis. All three axes have to be perpendicular to each other. So, we can establish our x and y axes with relative freedom as we just saw. However, the z axis has to be perpendicular to both. This really restricts where we can place our z-axis--it has to poke through the improvised xy-plane we've created. Going back to our very first example, however, what stopped me from placing my z-axis like this instead?</p> [image here]
<p>I mean, none of the rules about perpendicularity are violated here, right? In that case, we once again must retreat onto convention. In the two-dimensional case, the problem was that we wouldn't be able to rotate our coordinates back into their default position. The same thing would actually happen here. You wouldn't be able to rotate this first octant back into the place of the original first octant--the x and y axes would be flipped. I don't recommend trying to visualize this in your head because your brain will probably run out of RAM</p>
<p>We once again will need another heuristic to help us create a portable xyz-coordinate system wherever we go. Luckily, our hands have five fingers, and our right hand will once again come in handy. We're going to create a first octant with our fingers that we can rotate in any direction so that the right-hand rule can always apply. First, you're going to want to point your thumb upwards. Your thumb will be the z-axis. Second, point your index finger parallel to your desk. This will be your x-axis. Finally, point your middle finger out towards yourself. This is the y-axis. Here is what I mean.</p> [image here]
<p>This view is, on software, equivalent to this image.</p> [image here]
<p>Using this model, we can rotate our hand in any direction and see where our axes go. For example, we can simulate what happens when our xy-plane is directly on our screen. As we saw earlier, our z-axis points directly out of the screen at us.</p> [image here]
<p>Remember, the reason this works is that we can rotate our configuration of our fingers back into the default first octant position. Since our fingers are attached to our hands, when we rotate one finger, all of the other ones rotate to follow it along. </p>  
  <p>With that, we've successfully defined coordinates in 3 dimensinos, which will allow us to graph so many new things!</p>
