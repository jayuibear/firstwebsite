<p> More than six years ago as I'm writing this I began my journey with functions for the first time in 7th Grade with the simple idea of some sort of relationship such that for every input, there was always one output. First came lines and then exponentials. Quadratics and other polynomials followed suit. Afterwards, we entered the mysterious world of logarithms and trigonometric functions. Exploring those things were very fun, but only until I took multivariable calculus did I realize that this way of learning math was surprisingly limited. Everything took place on the xy-plane (unless we were looking at complex numbers, but the farthest we ever got with that was De Moivre's theorem). X was almost always the input, and y was the output. Functions only took in one input. Want to represent it graphically? Always put y in terms of x. It was sort of like a religion or some other sort of belief system. I really thought that these single-variable functions taking an input x and outputting some y = f(x) was the progression of math, and that viewpoint worked up through most of single-variable calculus. Anything else would seem like blasphemy to a younger me. I first learned polar coordinates in 10th Grade, and honestly, it really felt off at first. Considering that I had been working with two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates ever since at the latest Fourth Grade, I had never bothered to think that a coordinate system could be arranged in any other way (technically speaking, theta and r can still be represented along a rectangular grid, which we'll investigate later on). Yet at the same time, there was nothing, really, that said that coordinates had to contain the abscissa and the ordinate, aside from it being maybe a somewhat obvious choice? The point is, it really was like being locked into one world view. Parametric equations completely blew my socks off as well--the fact that the variables themselves could be outputs of other functions was just...too different at first. It went against everything that I had learned, even though conceptually it made a lot of sense. I thought to myself, "that's not what math is!" but obviously that's a very closed-minded way of looking at mathematics. I had, really, up until that point saw math as just another tale, like a story, that was going to unfold in front of me. I thought all the rules were already set in stone from the days we started learning algebra, and while in many ways they were, the ways in which these structures were represented seemed to violate natural law, as it seemed. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, by the time I had gained a sufficient understanding of single-variable calculus, I thought that I had matured pretty well mathematically. I truly was naive. I thought the way it was going to work was that we'd seperately learn things like linear algebra, differential equations, and multivariable calculus all in their seperate vacuums. We'd prove them rigorously in real analysis, and if you wanted to jump into some obscure branch of math you could take up topology or probability theory. I chose to ignore a big idea in math, that so many things are connected together, and that new ways of representing familiar concepts are always around the corner. After all, I have always wished for intuitive and common-sense explanations for math terms that require a lot of jargon, and in a sense, much of math is like that since it is used to describe phenomena all around us every day. When I first took this course, however, I was excited, but also a bit confused. I mean, really, what was there going to be? Like, I learned how to differentiate and integrate functions; is this course going to be just that but f(x,y) instead of f(x)? And, spoiler alert, yes, a large part of multivariable calculus is learning the intuition and hammering the steps of partial differentiation and multiple integration into your head, but there's a lot more. A lot of it involves vectors, vector functions, vector fields, matrices, I could go on. In other words, a lot of the things that caught me off guard came from linear algebra. I wondered why I was even allowed to take this course before linear algebra sometimes, and while I'm sure there exists a more natural way of teaching mathematics that would make all of this flow more smoothly, I hadn't realized that one, there is a multitude of ways to think about what a function of several variables even is, and two, it was unfair for me to desire some space where each of these concepts would be taught completely independently. When I was in elementary school, the units about geometry and multiplying numbers seemed so different. It was weird--sometimes I didn't even consider them the same subject. I think I was naively hoping for a return to that since I was exiting high school an entering a new chapter in my academic life. I was hoping that maybe multivariable calculus, discrete structures, linear algebra, and differential equations would all just do some sort of dance and combine into a megalithic structure somewhere called "MATH" that we'd explore in more rigorous undergraduate studies. But like I said earlier, math doesn't exist in a vacuum (although a lot of the physical world that it attempts to explain does in many problems). There will be a lot of totally new things you'll learn about in multivariable calculus. You might curse your teachers for not introducing these wonderful delights to you earlier, and I have too. Maybe one day we'll find a better way to put them into our education, but for now, let's be happy that we have the chance to explore them now rather than never. </p>
<p>I put this website together the way I did as a compromise between what I found in my class's textbook and a more natural progression of learning. My class used Stewart's Multivariable Calculus, 7th Edition (the books written by the guy who's obsessed with putting integral symbols on the cover), and while I agree with most of the general structure, there's a few things that don't seem natural to me. I also don't like the ways in which new concepts are presented in Stewart's book. The goal should be to arrive at a formula or theorem from coming up with a problem and working out its solution. This is a more natural way of approaching mathematics, and I want to make anyone viewing this website feel like they could've derived these formulas, albeit in a very crude, non-rigorous way, themselves. </p>
<p>I want to give a special thank you to my beautiful girlfriend who shall remained unnamed, to Grant Sanderson, also known as 3Blue1Brown, for being my inspiration to undertake anything like this, to Joshua Danufsky and Roy Zipstein for being two amazing instructors, to James Stewart for writing the textbook I frequently consult, to the Overleaf team for creating an online LaTeX editor, to all of the StackExchange helpers and image creators whose work I use, to H. M. Schey as the author of "Div, grad, curl, and all that", and finally, to you, for taking some time out of your day to enjoy something that I've created. Let's get started. </p>
