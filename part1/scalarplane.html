<h1>Scalar Equation of a Plane</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We've looked at a lot of different types of functions in three dimensions, many of paraboloids while others were more abstract. The purpose of this was to demonstrate that the immense beauty and compelxity of functions that we encountered in two dimensions also exist in space, but unlike what I'd usually aim to do in this sort of explanation, they were rather complex. So, taking a sudden break from the more complicated ideas we explored in the last page, let's think of the simplest possible functions that we can, and see if we can gain any insight from them. </p>
<h2>The Simplest Functions</h2>
<p>What makes a function simple? In higher-level mathematics, there is an actual category of functions called "simple functions", but that's way out of the scope of what we need. But, I think we'd all agree that a simple function doesn't take much work to describe. In two dimensions, we can agree that f(x) = x^2, g(x) = sin(x), and h(x) = e^x are much simpler than f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 -2x + 1, g(x) = sin^2(x)cos(x), and h(x)=x(e^x). Here's a question, though. What's simpler? f(x) = x^2, or g(x) = sin(x). There's no real answer, but for the sake of this exercise, I would argue that x^2 is much simpler because its behavior is easier to describe. How do you describe the behavior of a function? Arguably, looking at a function's derivatives and higher-order derivatives is one of the best ways, and as Taylor Series have shown, sometimes they're all that's needed to describe a function in its entirety. x^2 only has two derivatives with non-zero values, while sin(x) has infinitey many. Either way, sin(x) is still a function that isn't that hard to study because it has a very geometric definition and is all based on patterns, and it's not as complicated as a sine function combined with some other function. So, in general, the complexity of a function is based on two things: the number of terms (and how they are connected, as we saw in the final example with traces), and the complexity of its derivatives. Therefore, the simplest function possible is one that, at face value, is very easy to describe, and would preferibly have no derivatives. A function that constantly has a derivative of 0 is just a constant, which happens to be very easy to describe (perhaps it would be best to call it a polynomial of degree 0). </p> [pic here]
<p>In two dimensions, we could just express this simply as f(x) = a, where a is a constant, which we know as a horizontal line. The question is, how do we express this in 3-dimensions? Well, we already have, we just didn't express them as functions--we just called them planes with specific equations. Now that we know a few basic properties of functions of two-variable inputs, however, we'll be able to gain a better understanding of planes, the simplest multivariable functions.</p>
<p>We're trying to evolve from the function f(x) = a to f(x,y) = a. In essence, for the two-dimensional case, the value of f(x) was a regardless of the value of x. In the three-dimensional case, what happens? I think you could figure that out pretty easily, but it's a good habit to practice the skills that we've learned recently, specifically, the use of traces. Now, traces sound really, really weird for a function that's just a constant, but we can still use them. The simplest function that's a plane is just f(x,y) = 0, and in this case, let's look for traces in the plane (planes and planes!) parallel to the xz-axis, y = 1. y is set to 1, and we let x vary. Of course, no matter how much we shift the value of x along the number line on the plane y = 1, f(x,y), or z, is always 0, resulting in a line, which makes sense as we're essentially reverting our function to a two-dimensional shadow. So far, we have something that looks like this:  </p>
<p>What happens if we draw our trace along the line y = 2? y = 3? y= -1? Well, we'll plot those here too, but as it turns out, these lines are parallel and unchanging. You can see the plane starting to form, and indeed, as was quite obvious, we simply have a sheet that has a z value of 0 always, or the xy-plane. That's not much a surprise, and we could also graph traces parallel to the yz-plane at specific x-values, which, when overlaid, would produce the same results. This is something that we could do for any plane f(x,y) = a, producing linear traces parallel to the x and y-axes. One interesting to note is the vertical traces, or the lack thereof. When it came to elliptic paraboloids, for instance, it was fascinating to see how a function could appear both eliptical and quadratic at the same time, yet think about what would happen to vertical slices for our plane. This sort of constant plane is very special in that the function itself <i>is</i> a slice. Look at the plane f(x,y) = 0. If you tried to use a knife to slice the function at z = 1 or z = -1, you'd hit literally nothing, revealing nothing to an observer. On the other hand, if you sliced it at z = 0, you would expose the entire function! This is a very interesting property of simple planes that we wouldn't have found as easily if we hadn't thought about traces.</p>
<h2>Plane and Simple</h2>
<p>Looking at these examples, and the earlier examples of planes parallel to other axes, like the yz-axis or xz-axis, it's safe to say that it's pretty obvious what a plane is. It's like a sheet, a board, it's...well, a plane. This is another one of those things where we have a great conceptual understanding of what something is without knowing a more precise mathematical definition.</p>
