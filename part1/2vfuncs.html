<h1>Functions of Two Variables</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>With the ability to utilize our three-dimensional coordinate system, it is now possible to graph functions of two variable inputs. First, let's think about functions of one variable input on the xy-plane. The most common type was that of y = f(x), though x = f(y) also sometimes made an appearance. We chose a point on the x-axis, which was basically a number line, and the output corresponded to a height parallel to the y-axis that was equal to the value of the function. For two variable inputs, the most common variant is to use the xy-plane as the input space and output a z-value. In other words, instead of just having a number line as our input, we can choose any pair of numbers on the floor. Let's use (3,4). We then input our point into some sort of function f(x,y).The output will be the height above the xy-plane, or the z-value. So, what will the graph of a function f(x,y) look like? Well, that of course depends on what we pick. Let's graph the function f(x,y,) = xy.</p>
<p>First, let's think about the domain of our function. Are there any values of x or y where our function would be undefined? Well, no. We can put in any two dimensional point (x,y) in our function without a discontinuity or undefined value. That's nice. What does this say about our function? Well, let's look at our input space (remember, this is xy-plane now). Particularly, let's look at the square marked by the origin and the point (1,1).</p>
