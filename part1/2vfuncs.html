<h1>Functions of Two Variables</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>With the ability to utilize our three-dimensional coordinate system, it is now possible to graph functions of two variable inputs. First, let's think about functions of one variable input on the xy-plane. The most common type was that of y = f(x), though x = f(y) also sometimes made an appearance. We chose a point on the x-axis, which was basically a number line, and the output corresponded to a height parallel to the y-axis that was equal to the value of the function. For two variable inputs, the most common variant is to use the xy-plane as the input space and output a z-value. In other words, instead of just having a number line as our input, we can choose any pair of numbers on the floor. Let's use (3,4). We then input our point into some sort of function f(x,y).The output will be the height above the xy-plane, or the z-value. So, what will the graph of a function f(x,y) look like? Well, that of course depends on what we pick. Let's graph the function f(x,y,) = xy.</p>
<p>First, let's think about the domain of our function. Are there any values of x or y where our function would be undefined? Well, no. We can put in any two dimensional point (x,y) in our function without a discontinuity or undefined value. That's nice. What does this say about our function? Well, let's look at our input space (remember, this is xy-plane now). Particularly, let's look at the square marked by the origin and the point (1,1).</p> [image here]
<p>Every point in this square will have a specific output because the function is defined for all values of x and y. If every point on the rectangle has a corresponding point on the function, then the output will look like a patch above the input space, which is just that square in our example. For f(x,y) = xy, we have this curvy bit: </p> [image here]
<p>The important part here is to note that our function will create this patch with a height equivalent to the output of the function. The thing is, this idea of making a "patch" applies across the entire xy-plane. So, what we end up doing is making a surface. Functions of x and y tend to be surfaces, though many have discontinuities. Here is the function f(x,y,) = xy where both x and y range from -5 to 5. </p> [image here]
<p>We will later take the time to describe functions of two variables in more depth when we start talking about calculus with multivariable functions, but for now, the point is to understand what they look like graphically. If you're wondering what a function with a discontinuity looks like, by the way, consider the function f(x,y) = cos(x)/y where x and y range from -1 to 1. Notice that there is an infinite discontinuity where the value of y is 0 anywhere in the function. We will pay attention to discontinuities more when we talk about the limits of multivariable functions, which are surprisingly more difficult than those of functions of a single variable. You should already realize that a lot of properties that were interesting to us in single-variable calculus come back in multivariable form. For example, how would you describe how steep a graph is in a certain area? </p>  
<h2>Graphing Functions of Two Variables </h2>
<p>I've demonstrated some functions so far, and I've been using software to draw them as of now. Of course, if you're in an area where a computer is inaccessible, or if you're taking a test, that's a luxury that you can't have. So, with a pencil and straightedge (and perhaps a calculator), how do you graph multivariable functions? I'm asking this because we're used to it being really easy to graph single-variable functions. Take, for example, f(x) = x^2. The recommended course of action here, if you hadn't already known what the graph looks like, is to plot a few points around the origin. Maybe make a table, and plot the points. You'd get the general shape of the graph. Try doing this with multivariable functions though. Do you make two tables? Take, for example, the function f(x,y) = xy like we saw earlier. Here are eight points that have been plotted. Do you think you'd be able to accurately draw a graph? Maybe, and it would probably get better if you added another 8 or 10 points, but it might be hard to capture the whole essence of the function. And plus, that was just within a 1 by 1 square. Think about having to graph much more of the function. It's safe to say that we need another system, but what would that even be? </p>  
<p>Let's start our discussion by considering a different function: f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2. Try graphing it for yourself. You might be able to get it after a while, but it would still take some work. If you played around with it long around, though. Maybe, just maybe, you'd realize that some points share the same z-value. For example, f(3,4) = f(4,3) = f(5,0) = f(0,5) = 25. Then, it would be wise to look at our function everywhere where z is 25. Since they lay on one layer of z, we can maybe draw some sort of curve on the plane z = 25. There has to be some sort of system of equations we can solve to find all of the values of x and y such that z is equal to 25. In other words, find x and y such that f(x,y) = z where f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 and z = 25. Substituting these values, we get 25 = x^2 + y^2. Hey, this looks familiar. Yes, this is a circle of radius 5 centered at the origin, or, sort of. It's centered at the point where x = 0 and y = 0, but keep in mind that this entire curve occupies the area where z = 25, so the center really is at (0,0,25). Anyway, this means that when we take a slice of our function at z = 25, we would see a circle of radius 5. Consider what would happen when z = 24. We would have x^2 + y^2 = 24, or a circle of radius 2 root 6, once again centered around the z-axis, but at z = 24, meaning we have a circle of slightly lower radius at a slightly lower height. At z = 26, we would have x^2 + y^2 = 26, which is a circle of radius root 26 centered around the z-axis at a slightly higher height. All three curves can be plotted as such, which, to be honest, are hard to differentiate. </p> [image here]
<p>Let's graph more circles at higher and lower z-values. </p> [image here]
<p>It's clear that by doing this, a shape is definitely forming. We're doing this by basically "disregarding" the z-component of the function and only looking at what x and y are doing at each value of z. What if, however, we do what we did when we defined what the xy, xz, and yz planes were? As in, we basically said that z was 0. Hold on, what does this even mean? Well, you might arrive here naturally by looking directly down at our surface. </p> [image here]
<p>We have these concentric disks, the largest of which being the uppermost circle. What causes this phenomenon? Well, when we look directly down at our surface, we can't tell different z-values apart, so we're only focusing on what x and y are doing and can effectively treat every z-value as the floor. This phenomenon is known as tracing--we're looking at the traces of f(x,y) in the xy-plane. It also lets us know that every slice of our function is a circle, and these circles end up having very large radii. That begs the question though, what do other traces look like? What if we looked at what our function did at particular values of x, for example. If we set x to constantly equal 1 , we would end up with z = 1 + y^2. In essence, we're holding x constant at 1 and letting y vary across many numbers. This is a curve z = f(y) such that it lies on the plane x = 1. What's interesting, though, is that this is a parabola. While we were able to construct our function out of circles, if we let x equal many different numbers, perhaps we can also view its structure this way as well? Notice that for some x value a, our equation becomes z = a + y^2, which is a curve on the plane x = a. If we put a bunch of different values of x together, we get something like this: </p> [image here]
<p>And, if we were to completely disregard the values of x by looking at the traces on the yz-plane, we'd see this: </p> [image here]
<p>Make no mistake, these are traces of the same function. However, the first time, we looked at layers that were sliced horizontally going up. We then looked down those layers. We saw from that perspective, we saw layers of circles being placed on top of each other. This time, instead of slicing our function horizontally, we sliced it with planes parallel to the y-axis. When we viewed what was on each slice, we saw parabolas. This means that the different parents of the function have different appearances depending on how we look at them. The complete function is combining all of these perspectives together. To do this, let's consider what our function looks like when we slice it by fixing y at specific values. We now have z = x^2 + b, where b is a specific value of y. This creates a curve on the plane y = b. </p> [image here]
<p>We once again have parabolas, but notice that these traces would lie on the xz-plane rather than the yz-one. In other words, when we look at the function vertically, we see circles. If we look at the function projected onto the horizontally aligned axes' planes, we see parabolas. Now, if we combine all three of these perspectives together, maybe we'll be able to see the full function. Let's do that near the origin. </p> [image here]
<p>It seems we have this interesting shape that sort of looks like, for the lack of a better term, a 3D parabola. Indeed, this is what we'd get if we rotated a parabola around the origin. It has a special name: a paraboloid. Here's a better graphical representation of what we just drew with traces. </p> [image here]
<p>Note that on the graphing calculator, you can actually see the traces as contour lines on the side!</p>
