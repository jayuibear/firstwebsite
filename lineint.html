<h1> Line integrals </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> In calculus of a single variable, change seemed quite easy to measure. When we investigated the notion of the directional derivative, however, we realized that once you include more dimensions, the possibilities become endless. We could see how much a function would change for a small step in any direction, not just along the x or y axes. Even around one point, the behavior of a function could change significantly depending on the direction we were headed.</p>
<p> What about integrals, then? What about integrals in a certain direction? This might seem preposterous at first. After all, integrals in space occur over entire regions, so it's not like we can just pick a direction to go with. But recall one of the geometric interpretations of double integrals--the idea of cross sections being integrated across an axis. For the sake of that chapter, we looked at cross sections for traces with respect to one axis and then integrated again to form a double integral. However, we limited these cross sections to be perpendicular to the axes. Who says we can't have a cross section that follows a diagonal path underneath the curve? Remember, a cross section's area is just an integral in two dimensions, which is just a single integral. You might wonder if perhaps we can construct this sort of integral. We'd be going on some heterodox path for sure, but it's area under a curve, a concept from Calculus I.</p>
<p> So how would we go about doing this? Imagine we have some sort of surface f(x,y), and we want to find the "directional integral" going diagonally across the floor like so: [IMAGE HERE]. What I mean is, imagine findnig the area underneath the surface along that line. By restricting the surface to just that line, however, we're basically doing a very simple integration. We still need to know how we'd calculate it, though. </p>
<p> The first question we should ask to try to tackle this problem is, "With respect to what are we integrating?" It's not with respect to x or y. We might be tempted to say both, but that would create a double integral. It seems as if we're integrating with respect to the line on the floor, but how do we express that? We can't express our bounds in both x and y at the same time, then we'd have two variables! We need a way to use a single integral to repersent tiny changes in both x and y.</p>
<p> So, let's recap what we've figured out so far. We need to integrate along the line on the floor. The line has both changing x and y values. If only we had a way to make x and y both dependent on some other variable. At this point, a light bulb should go off in your head. Make x and y dependent on some other variable? Let's parametrically define our line. The line in question here is simply y=x, which we could represent as x(t) = t, and y(t) = t. We see that a change "on the line" is really the change of the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by changes in both x and y. Before we dig deeper into this aspect, let's remind ourselves what an integral is. It's the limit of a bunch of Riemann sums, more specifically, the areas of rectangles, only this time, our rectangle width is a little bit of the length of the line. Our height, of course, is the value of the function at a point on this small bit of length. So the area of each rectangle is "value of function" times "small bit of arc length". We of course will sum these and take the limit as the width of these rectangles approaches 0.</p>
<p> We want to integrate everything with respect to one variable, t. I always imagine t as being time--imagine traveling along this curve over a period of time and gradually adding these rectangles.</p>
<p> Let's do the easy part first, which is defining our function parametrically. The example I gave is z = x^2 + y^2. Since x and y both equal t, we can say that z= 2t^2. Think about what that means. For any bit of time (let's say, I don't know, seconds?) the height of our curve is equal to twice to our amount of time in seconds squared. Now, we need to represent our small change in arc length, which we conventionally call dS. Well, we're going to say that this tiny change in arc length is equal to a tiny change in time multiplied by something. What is this something? Well, it's going to be the length of our hypotenuse. This is of course, [insert link]. We eventually end up with [insert link]. Think about it. That makes sense, right? On a straight line, for a small change in time, the change in the hypotenuse is also going to be linear, just with a different slope.</p>
<p> So, where do we end up? Now that we have everything in terms of t, let's put it together. We end up with this integral: [put image here]. So, what if we want to integrate from (0,0) to (1,1)? You might be tempted to say it's the integral from 0 to 1. Well, in this case you'd be right, but remember, we have to consider what values of t correspond to the bounds of integration. Our final definite integral is thus [insert image].</p>
<p> Wow. Think about what we did for a second. We basically found a way to evaluaet a directional integral. And for our line, it's not really too different from a directional derivative in the reverse direction. I mean, we're just integrating our original function multiplied by some constant which accounts for our Pythagorean shenanigans. There's a more formal name for this "directional integral"--a line integral. The notation looks like this: [insert image]</p>
<p> Play around with this for different functions. If you spent a long enough time doing that, a thought might cross your mind. You could connect a bunch of these lines and calculate these line integrals, each next one starting where the last one left off. You can make these really interesting lined paths for yourself. Now, ask yourself, what would happen if we took a bunch of tiny lines and connected them together? That's right. Then we'd be looking at a curve. We can make these line integrals go over curves now! </p>
<p> No, you don't have to integrate a line integral again to account for the many different tiny lines that form up a curve. That's actually already covered in our original definition of the line integral, specifically, defining the arc length parametrically. Remember, if we zoom into certain parts of our curve, our "right triangle" will look different, meaning that our derivatives will carry different values as well. These derivatives are derived from our original function which we've defined parametrically, and our derivatives are already defined parametrically inside of our arc length formula. That means that as long as we can define our little path parametrically, we can find these the areas marked by these "cross sections." Now I think that's pretty cool, don't you? These are still called line integrals, by the way, even though they're over curves. </p>
